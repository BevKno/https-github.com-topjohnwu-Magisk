<h1>Properly contributing</h1>

<h2>Bug reporting</h2>

- __ALWAYS INCLUDE LOGS IF POSSIBLE/RELEVANT.__
Get both a logcat and magisk logs if possible

- Always make sure to test with the latest Canary build, to 
make sure it hasn't already been resolved

- Include an accurate description of the problem/
how to reproduce

- Include device, ROM & version, and version of magisk

- Don't report some random app detects root with magisk
 hide, as topjohnwu has had too many of these to
deal with

- Search around on xda, this issue tracker, and elsewhere to
see if your issue is already resolved another way

Bad example:
It bootloop pls help

Good example:
On my Moto z3 play running Resurrection Remix 7.0.2, 
enabling any modules causes a bootloop. I've tested
with Canary version 19.2, and stable version 19.1. I've tried
to resolve this by reflashing magisk. Here are my logs 

magisk-logs.txt, logcat.txt
