# Magisk

### How to build Magisk

1. Download and install NDK
2. Add the NDK directory into `PATH`
To check if the `PATH` environment variable is set correctly, try calling `which ndk-build` (`where ndk-build` on Windows) and see if it shows the NDK directory you've just configured
3. Unix-like users (e.g. Linux & MacOS) please execute `build.sh` through shell  
Windows users please execute `build.cmd` through cmd
4. The scripts will show you further instructions and details
